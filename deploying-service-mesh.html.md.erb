This topic describes how to deploy service mesh for Pivotal Application Service (PAS).

For more information about service mesh, see [Service Mesh (Beta)](../adminguide/service-mesh.html).


## <a id="configuring-pas"></a> Enable in PAS

To deploy service mesh, configure PAS as follows:

1. Select **Networking - Service Mesh** in the PAS tile.

1. Under **Service mesh (beta)**, select **Enable**. 

1. For **IP addresses for Istio router**, do the following depending on your IaaS:
	* **vSphere**: Enter static IPs for the Istio routers. You must configure your load balancer with these IPs as well. 
	* **Other**: Leave this field blank. 

1. For **External domain**, enter the domain for Istio routers. The default domain is `mesh.app-domain.com`.

1. For **Istio router TLS keypairs**, complete the following fields. You can add more than one keypair if desired using the **Add** button.
	* **Name**: Enter a name for the keypair. 
	* **Certificate and private key for Istio router**: Enter the private key and certificate for TLS handshakes with clients. These must be in PEM block format. 

1. Click **Save**. 


## <a id="create-load-balancer"></a> Create a Load Balancer

To configure a load balancer for service mesh, do the following. The exact procedure varies by IaaS. 

1. Create a load balancer with:
	* A static IP
	* Health check port 8002 and path `/healthcheck`
	* Firewall rules to allow the following:
		* HTTP on port 80
		* HTTP on port 8002
		* TLS on port 443

1. Navigate to your DNS provider and create a DNS name that resolves to the IP of the load balancer:
	* If you did not configure the **External Domain** field in the PAS tile, create the DNS name using the default value of `*.mesh.YOUR-CF-APPS-DOMAIN`. 
	*  If you configured the **External Domain** field in the PAS tile, create the DNS name using the value you configured. 

## <a id="resource-config"></a> Add Load Balancer to Resource Config

If your deployment is on an IaaS other than vSphere, do the following after you create your load balancer:

1. Select **Resource Config** in the PAS tile. 

1. In the **Load Balancer** column of the **istio-router** row, enter the name of the load balancer you created. 

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
